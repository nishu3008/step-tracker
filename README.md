# step-tracker

This project is a Step Tracker application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its core function is to help users monitor their daily physical activity by counting steps. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive.

Key features include:

Progress Visualization: A central display shows the user's current step count and their progress toward a daily goal, represented by a circular progress bar.

Automatic Tracking: The app can utilize device motion sensors to automatically count steps.

Manual Entry: Users have the flexibility to manually add steps to their total.

Goal Setting: Users can set and customize their daily step goal.

Functionality: The application likely uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, update the step count, calculate progress percentage, and manage data storage (perhaps using the browser's local storage).
